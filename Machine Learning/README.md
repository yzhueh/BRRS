  The trained model was utilized to segment the whole dataset, and the average RGB value of each segmented band was extracted and used as input for the classification models.  Segmented test bands were subsequently classified by random forest model as HPV positive or negative according to their RGB value (Figure 5E). Finally, a classification model was used to assign disease concentrations and risk levels (L1, L2) to each band (Figure 5F). The agglomerative clustering method performed best of the clustering methods we tested, especially in the high sensitive range. The successful correlation between machine learning-based classification and naked eye-based distinction suggests that the machine learning model could speed up the analysis of experimental results through high-confidence algorithms. Thus, BRRS provided a simple-yet-efficient way to realize accurate diagnosis of HPV stages from original LFA images directly.
